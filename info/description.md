The Hamming distance between two binary integers is the number of bit positions that differs
([read more about the Hamming distance on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance)).
For example:

```
117 = 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
 17 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
  H = 0+1+1+0+0+1+0+0 = 3
```

You are given two positive numbers (N, M) in decimal form.
You should calculate the Hamming distance between these two numbers in binary form.
