**How it is used:**

This is a basis for Hamming code and other linear error-correcting programs.
The Hamming distance is used in systematics as a measure of genetic distance.
On a grid (ie: a chessboard,) the Hamming distance is the minimum number of moves
it would take a rook to move from one cell to the other.
